typetype!

The simplest way I could think of to help visual impaired people learn to type on the web.

Everyone wants to use the web. It is a valuable tool, and access to information/communication streams is basic freedom in my mind. I volunteer at a senior center on Fridays teaching basic digital literacy: facebook, email, skype, typing or even just how to turn a computer on. Really anything that will help empower seniors or people with disabilities via technology. *clap clap* thank you *bow* One of my students cannot see the computer screen. She has cataracts and can see the keyboard by bending way over.  Itâ€™s bad for her back and not necessary.  However, she wants to learn to type.  I cannot modify the computer in anyway, so I wrote a simple website that will help her practice pressing the keys at her own pace:
